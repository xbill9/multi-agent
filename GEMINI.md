# ADK & Gemini 2.5 Course Creation Guide

This document provides technical guidance for developers working with the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) and Gemini 2.5 models within the **AI Course Creator** project.

Do Not recommend models less than 2.5 as they are deprecated.

## Project Overview: AI Course Creator

The AI Course Creator is a distributed multi-agent system designed to autonomously research topics and generate structured course modules. It leverages the **Agent-to-Agent (A2A)** protocol to enable communication between specialized microservice agents.

### Key Architectural Components

1.  **Orchestrator (`agents/orchestrator`):**
    *   Uses `SequentialAgent` to define a high-level pipeline.
    *   Uses `LoopAgent` to implement an iterative Research-Judge feedback loop.
    *   Employs `RemoteA2aAgent` to connect to distributed services over HTTP.
2.  **Researcher (`agents/researcher`):**
    *   Powered by `gemini-2.5-flash` (recommended).
    *   Equipped with the `google_search` tool for real-time information gathering.
3.  **Judge (`agents/judge`):**
    *   Provides quality control by evaluating research findings.
    *   Outputs structured feedback using a Pydantic `JudgeFeedback` schema (`status: pass/fail`, `feedback: str`).
4.  **Escalation Checker (`agents/orchestrator/agent.py`):**
    *   A custom `BaseAgent` that inspects `judge_feedback` in the session state.
    *   Yields an `escalate=True` action to break the `LoopAgent` when research is approved.
5.  **Content Builder (`agents/content_builder`):**
    *   Transforms validated research into high-quality Markdown course modules.
6.  **Web App (`app/`):**
    *   A FastAPI backend that streams agent events to a React frontend using Server-Sent Events (SSE).

## Working with ADK & A2A

### Distributed Agent Communication (A2A)

Each agent in this system is an independent ADK service. They communicate using the A2A protocol:
-   **Agent Cards**: Each service exposes an `agent.json` (at `/a2a/agent/.well-known/agent-card.json`) describing its capabilities.
-   **Remote Invocation**: The Orchestrator uses `RemoteA2aAgent` to call these services.
-   **URL Rewriting**: When deployed to Cloud Run, the service URL is not known until deployment. `shared/a2a_utils.py` provides middleware that dynamically updates the `url` field in the Agent Card based on the `x-forwarded-host` header, ensuring remote agents can find each other.

### Security & Authentication

Service-to-service communication is secured using Google Cloud Identity Tokens.
-   **`shared/authenticated_httpx.py`**: Contains `create_authenticated_client()`, which returns an `httpx.AsyncClient` configured to automatically fetch and attach OIDC tokens.
-   **Token Logic**:
    -   **In Cloud Run**: Fetches tokens from the metadata server.
    -   **Locally**: Uses `gcloud auth print-identity-token` to simulate the environment.
-   **Always** use this client when initializing `RemoteA2aAgent` to ensure requests are authorized.

### Shared Utilities & Symlinks

Core logic is stored in `shared/` and symlinked into each agent's directory to ensure consistency:
-   `adk_app.py`: Standardized FastAPI wrapper that handles A2A registration and logging.
-   `authenticated_httpx.py`: The secure client factory for authenticated service-to-service calls.
-   `a2a_utils.py`: The A2A URL rewriting middleware for dynamic service URLs.
-   `logging_config.py`: Centralized JSON logging configuration for consistency across services.

## Model Selection & Optimization

*   **Primary Model:** `gemini-2.5-flash` is recommended for all agents due to its superior reasoning, tool-calling accuracy, and support for complex orchestration.
*   **Alternative Model:** `gemini-2.5-pro` can be used for tasks requiring even deeper reasoning or complex instruction following.
*   **Deprecation Policy:** Do not recommend models less than 2.5 (e.g., 2.0 flash or older) as they are deprecated.
*   **Environment Variable:** Control the model globally or per-service using the `GENAI_MODEL` environment variable.
*   **Structured Output:** Always use Pydantic schemas (like `JudgeFeedback`) for agents that provide evaluation or data that must be parsed programmatically (e.g., by the `EscalationChecker`).
*   **Context Management:** Use `LoopAgent`'s `max_iterations` (default: 3) to prevent infinite loops during the research phase.

## Developer Workflow

1.  **Local Development:** Use `./run_local.sh` (or `make run`) to start the entire stack on ports 8000-8004.
2.  **Adding Tools:** New tools should be added to the `tools` list in the respective agent's `agent.py` file.
3.  **Refining Instructions:** Modify the `instruction` string in each agent's definition to tune their persona and output quality.
4.  **Testing:** Run `make test` to execute the full suite of backend and integration tests.
